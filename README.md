# Power Pages Code Components Demo
Thanks for stopping by! This is a demo of adding custom code components to a Power Pages site via web templates. This is a great way to add custom functionality to your site without having to use the PCF framework. This also frees you from having to attach your code components to a field or dataset. Videos are available on the Practical Power Platform channel on YouTube.

## Note
This repo will not make much sense without watching the videos. I've included the code components in this repo for reference, but you will need to watch the videos to see how they work.
